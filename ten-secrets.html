# Methods for rapid spectral screening

This post explains reproducible preprocessing steps for Raman and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Use this folder to store notes and code snippets that you later publish as a paper.

- Data cleaning and baseline correction
- Calibration transfer
- Model interpretability (SHAP, LIME)
